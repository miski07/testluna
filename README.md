Unadded feature:
1. Proper secure Token system
2. not everything requires header token (only some, to prove that i'm able)

for header just use the email u register with, email doesnt check valid input, so plain string is fine
needs cleaning, swagger availabe through springdoc on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
missing features can be added with more time
